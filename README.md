# Housing-Price-Prediction-
Housing price prediction is a significant area of study in the fields of data science and machine learning, 
given the complex factors that influence real estate markets. Accurate prediction of housing prices helps 
buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and policy makers make informed decisions. In this project, we will 
use a dataset of California housing prices, which contains key features such as location, population, 
median income, and housing characteristics, to develop a predictive model. By leveraging machine 
learning algorithms in Python, we aim to build a model that can forecast housing prices with high 
accuracy.
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Dataset, which contains information from the 
1990 U.S. Census. It includes demographic and geographical data, which are crucial to predicting
housing prices in various regions of California. This dataset has been widely used in machine learning 
tutorials, making it a valuable resource for understanding real-world housing prediction tasks.
The goal of this project is to explore various machine learning techniques, preprocess the data, and 
evaluate the performance of different models to predict housing prices based on the available features.
